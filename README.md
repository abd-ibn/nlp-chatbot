# FSTT Assistant ChatBOT

## Overview

This is an assistant chatbot application built for the FSTT (Facult√© des Sciences et Techniques de Tanger). It uses language models and Pinecone vector database to provide responses to user queries related to courses, trainings, modules, departments, clubs, and more.

## How to Run

1. First, navigate to the `app` folder in your terminal or command prompt.

2. Activate the virtual environment by running the following command:

   ```
   & "env/Scripts/Activate.ps1"
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file using pip:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up the API keys in the code:
   
   - You'll need a Pinecone API key for the vector database.
   - You'll need a Hugging Face API token for the language model (LLM) used in the application.

5. For the Pinecone vector database:
   
   - Run the notebook `3-embedding.ipynb` to store the necessary data for this project into your Pinecone index.

6. Finally, to run the application, execute the following command:

   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

This will start the Streamlit server and open the application in your default web browser. You can then interact with the chatbot by asking questions related to the FSTT.
